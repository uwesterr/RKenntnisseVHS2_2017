# Data visualisation
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse_packages()  # which packages are in tidyverse
```

## Where can I find useful packages?

- CRAN task list  https://cran.r-project.org
- r-bloggers search http://www.r-bloggers.com 

## Where can I find how to use packages

- Reference manual on CRAN
- Vignettes
- ?
- Demos




```{r}
# List vignettes from all *attached* packages
vignette(all = FALSE)
# List vignettes from all *installed* packages (can take a long time!):
vignette(all = TRUE)
# find vignettes of "ggplot2"
vignette(package = "ggplot2")
# view vignette "ggplot2-specs"  
vignette("ggplot2-specs")
```


now look for more information on ggplot

```{r}
?ggplot2
demo()          # find demos for attached packages
demo(graphics)  # A show of some of R's graphics capabilities, run in console

```


## lets look at the some data

note that the pipe can be run in parts (short cut Ctrl+Shift+M, CMD+SHIFT+M )

```{r}
mpg  %>% select(displ, cty, hwy, year)  %>% plot()

plot(select(mpg,displ,cty,hwy,year))
```



## Creating a ggplot

ggplot is part of the tidyverse and a widely used package to work with graphics 
**note** for ggplot there is "+" to combine commands, in contrast to "% > %" which is the pipe operator for commands outside ggplot


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


### Create a ggplot with color = class

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

### Create a ggplot with size = class

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

### Create a ggplot with alpha = class

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
```

### Create a ggplot with shape = class

**note** there are only 6 different shapes, therefore "suv" has no shape and is not displayed

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```



### Create plot where property of geom is set manually

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

## Recap
- Where would you check for packages?
- Where would you look on how to use packages?
- When would you use size as function of a value in a plot?


## Facets
If there is a variable value which separates data it can be used to create multiple plots rather than multiple lines in one plot.

### facet_wrap
facet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```


### facet_grid
facet_grid forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```



## Geometic objects
different ways to present the same data

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv, color = drv))
```

### avoid the legend


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
```


### display several geoms in same plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


### don't repeat code 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```


### use only subset of data for geom

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```


### bar plot for discrete x-data
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

# Statistical transformations

## box plot for discrete x- and continuous y-data

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price))
```


## Violin plot for discrete x- and continuous y-data
gives good impression of distribution

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, color = cut))
```

## Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data.

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogramm

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
# set binwidth
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
# set number of bins
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 200)
```

## use geom_freqpoly for easier comparison

```{r}
# Rather than stacking histograms, it's easier to compare frequency
# polygons
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, fill = cut)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, colour = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 500)
```


work with densities, means each curve has area of one

```{r}
# To make it easier to compare distributions with very different counts,
# put density on the y axis instead of the default count
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, ..density.., colour = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 500)
```

## Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF)

The empirical distribution function estimates the cumulative distribution function underlying of the points in the sample and converges with probability 1

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirische_Verteilungsfunktion


```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10000))
ggplot(df, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram()
ggplot(df, aes(x)) + stat_ecdf(geom = "step")

p  <- ggplot(df, aes(x)) + stat_ecdf()
pg <- ggplot_build(p)$data[[1]]
ggplot(pg, aes(x = x, y = 1-y )) + geom_step() + scale_y_log10() 



```

## Find correlations
In statistics relationship between two variables.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cor_iris <- cor(iris %>% select(-Species))
corrplot.mixed(cor_iris)

```

further details on the corrplot package can be found in the vignette

```{r}
vignette("corrplot-intro")
```

## Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC)

In statistics, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) is a measure of the strength of the linear or **non-linear** association between two variables X and Y.

```{r}

library(minerva)
compare_mic_r = function(x, y){
cat( "MIC:", mine(x,y)$MIC, ";", "correlation: ", cor(x,y), "\n")  
}
x <- runif(n=1000, min=0, max=1)
y2 <- 4*(x-0.5)^2; plot(sort(x),y2[order(x)],type="l"); compare_mic_r(x,y2)
y3 <- sin(6*pi*x*(1+x)); plot(sort(x),y3[order(x)],type="l"); compare_mic_r(x,y3)
t <- seq(from=0,to=2*pi,length.out=1000)
x4 <- cos(t); y4 <- sin(t); plot(x4, y4, type="l",asp=1); compare_mic_r(x4,y4)

```



## Recap

- Which geom seems useful for you?
- Any idea where could use facet plots for one of your tasks?
- What do you think about correlation and maximum information coefficient?


#  Data wrangling

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```


## filter rows

filter all rows where month == 1 and day ==1, multiple filter conditions are separated by ","

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


## store all x-mas flights

note, if you wrap the expression in () then the result will be displayed even when the result is assigned to a variable

```{r}
(xmas_flights <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 24))
```


## boolean operators work as well

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```


the following expressions give the same result


```{r}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```


## Arrange rows with arrange()


```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

## select columns with select()
also an easy way to bring columns in a specific order

```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```
select all but a range of columns

```{r}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```

more can be found in the cheatsheet 

## Add new variables with mutate()

note the %>% operator

```{r}
select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time) %>% 
mutate(
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours) %>% 
  select(-c(month, day, speed))
```

if you only want to keep the new columns use "transmute()"

```{r}
select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time) %>% 
transmute(
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours) 
```


## Grouped summaries with summarise()

the mean of all depature delays

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# na.rm	a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.

summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% as.numeric()

```



```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

find pattern of delays during the year

```{r}
by_day <- flights %>% group_by(year, month)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% ggplot(aes( x = month, y = delay, group = month)) +
  geom_col()
```



## Find planes with high delays

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  ) %>%
ggplot( mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)
```

there seems a few planes with very high mean delay. Lets look closer into the issue

```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```


the high delays are for tailnum wiht limited number of flight.
Lets choose only tailnums where at least 25 flights are recorded

```{r}
delays %>% 
  filter(n > 25) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```

what if we want to select the points under consideration not via a limit but from a plot? Use **Shiny Gadgets**

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(miniUI)

ggbrush <- function(data, xvar, yvar) {
  
  ui <- miniPage(
    gadgetTitleBar("Drag to select points"),
    miniContentPanel(
      # The brush="brush" argument means we can listen for
      # brush events on the plot using input$brush.
      plotOutput("plot", height = "100%", brush = "brush")
    )
  )
  
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    
    # Render the plot
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
      # Plot the data with x/y vars indicated by the caller.
      ggplot(data, aes_string(xvar, yvar)) + geom_point()
    })
    
    # Handle the Done button being pressed.
    observeEvent(input$done, {
      # Return the brushed points. See ?shiny::brushedPoints.
      stopApp(brushedPoints(data, input$brush, allRows = TRUE))
    })
  }
  
  runGadget(ui, server)
}
# pick_points(mtcars, ~wt, ~mpg)
brushed_points <- ggbrush(delays, "n", "delay")

brushed_points   %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay, color = selected_)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/10)

brushed_points   %>% filter(selected_ ==TRUE)  %>%  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay, color = selected_)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/3)

```



# Now a few more things we need for the EuropeLeagueTransfers.Rmd

## left_join

the data set nycflights13 has four tibbles (dataframes)

- airlines
- airports
- planes
- weather


```{r}
 airlines
 airports
 planes
 weather
```


## find the links between the data.frames


```{r}
library(visNetwork)
# this function creates a data.frame with the name of the data.frame and the names of the columns of that data.frame
create_df_of_names = function(df, name){
  data.frame(from = name, to = names(df))
}

# create a names list of the data.frames
a <- list(flights = flights,airlines = airlines, airports = airports, weather = weather,
          planes = planes) 
# and map them to build one data.frame with two columns
# - from contains all  data.frame names
# - to  contains all column names
edge <- map2_df(a,names(a), create_df_of_names)

# create a visNetwork

nodesFrom <-  edge %>% cbind(unlist(.$from),"Table") %>% select(3,4) %>% data.frame  
nodesTo <-  edge %>% cbind(unlist(.$to),"Attribute") %>% select(3,4) %>% data.frame 

names(nodesFrom) <- c("id", "group")
names(nodesTo) <- c("id", "group")

nodes <- rbind(nodesFrom,nodesTo) %>% unique() 
nodes$id <- as.character((nodes$id))  
nodes <- nodes %>% unique() %>% arrange(id)
visNetwork(nodes, edge)%>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = list(enabled = TRUE, degree = 2), nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %>%
  visEdges(arrows = "to") %>%  
  visGroups(groupname = "Table",     shape = "icon", icon = list(code = "f114", color = "green",size = 75)) %>%
  visGroups(groupname = "Attribute", shape = "icon", icon = list(code = "f115", color = "lightgreen", size = 45)) %>%
  addFontAwesome() 
# list of icons http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/

```

## lets find out which manufacturer has the highest delays

first we need to join flights with planes

```{r}
flight_planes <- left_join(flights, planes, by = "tailnum")

flight_planes %>% group_by(manufacturer) %>% summarise(delay_per_flight = sum(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)/ n(),number_of_flights = n()) %>% arrange(desc(delay_per_flight))

```

## lets find out which airline has the highest delays
first we need to join flights with planes

```{r}
flight_airlines <- left_join(flights, airlines)

flight_airlines %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(delay_per_flight = sum(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)/ n(),number_of_flights = n()) %>% arrange(desc(delay_per_flight))

```



## long and wide data.frames

for some operations the tidy wide format is not suitable as input to an operation, then a "long" version of the data.frame can be generated using the "melt" command.


A further example will be shown in **EuropeLeagueTransfers.Rmd** and further information on the topic can be found at http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html 

```{r}
library(reshape2)
names(airquality) <- tolower(names(airquality))
aqm <- melt(airquality, id=c("month", "day"),
  variable.name = "climate_variable", 
  value.name = "climate_value")
head(airquality)
head(aqm)
tail(aqm)

```

Cast functions cast (deutsch: gießen) a molten data frame into an array or data frame.
is the reverse function of melt and will be used in **EuropeLeagueTransfers.Rmd**

```{r}
aqw <- dcast(aqm, month + day ~ climate_variable)
head(aqw) 
```


## last thing we need for EuropeLeagueTransfers.Rmd

**grepl** returns a logic vector given an expression

```{r}
letters
grep("[a-c]", letters)
grep("[a-z]", letters)
grepl("[a-c]", letters)
grepl("[a-z]", letters)

```


# Lets dive into some code

**EuropeLeagueTransfers.Rmd**
